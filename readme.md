The target is flanked by non-target stimuli which correspond either to the same
directional response as the target (congruent flankers), to the opposite
response (incongruent flankers), or to neither (neutral flankers).
The test can be used to assess the ability to suppress responses that are
inappropriate in a particular context.

Randomisation is according to these rules:

* No more then 3 consecutive sides (direction).
* No more then 2 consecutive flanker (congruency).
* Never two consecutive trials that have the same congruency AND side.
